PokeFusion is an app that allows the user to fuse the 151 (first gereneration) pokemons
This app has a very simple Presenter, just choose between the head pokemon and the body pokemon and tap on Fuse button.

For some reason if the fuse call returns a error it will display this error page:

The real idea behind this app is to show a very complex code architecture, Unit/widget tests and some Solid Principles as such: TDD, Design Patterns, Single responsability, etc. It also has a MicroApp to handle the complex widgets.
