For some reason if the fuse call returns a error it will display this error page:

The real idea behind this app is to show a very complex code architecture, Unit/widget tests and some Solid Principles as such: TDD, Design Patterns, Single responsability, etc. It also has a MicroApp to handle the complex widgets.

Also, this app will be posted on PlayStore for everyone download for free!
